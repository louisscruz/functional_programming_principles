# Functional Programming Principles

The repository is a collection of my work for Martin Odersky's course
on functional programming through Coursera.

[The course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) has a term of six
weeks and generally serves as an introduction to [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).
